v2.0rc13

* envelope editor got tooltips (!!!)
* when volume envelope is set to "Factory" prevent editing to avoid
  confusion when changes made have no effect (happened to me)
  even though technically you can edit the envelope 'offline', avoiding
  confusion has priority
* draw envelope values at cursor instead of box (better eye-hand coordination)
* removed unused variables, made code C11 compliant, -Wall -W cleanup
* minipiano got tooltip
* keyboard got tooltips
* slightly increased saturation for some of the default colors


v2.0rc12

* a new drug was developed: the arp editor got a xxxx seperate window.
* arp editor: root note selector added, so offset note values show relative
  to a note of your choice
* minipianos: middle click a key to set the note and velocity that is being
  played back when pressing 'B' (default is A 3). middle click on the case
  to just set the velocity
  NOTE: this only works with the minipianos since the big keyboard uses the
  middle-mouse button to set the layer transpose value.
* ask for confirmation when about to change the multisetup and there are
  unsaved changes


v2.0rc11

* autofocus knobs when hovered.
* minipianos: mousewheel can shift keyrange (octave)
* when saving a preset, update the internal clone too
* tuned range of the ultra cool scope.
* fixed status display


v2.0rc10

* channel selection doesn't work properly (rc9 regression). fixed.
* mixer flickers when changing preset/channel/edit all. fixed.
* master volume saved with config (default lvl: 80).
  will be applied on startup.
* pressing escape while in the arp editor, closes the arp editor, not prodatum


v2.0rc9

* program arp "COPY FROM": ROM selector would not update preset brwosa. fixed.
* slightly compressed preferences dialog
* synchronization got a turbo (***):
  v2.0rc8: 2m 09s
  v1.0.0:  1m 13s
  v2.0rc9: 1m 1s
* "Delay" effect on synchronizing (***):
  0ms:   1m 1s (check your browsers, may result in missing names)
  10ms:  1m 3s (safe option for me)
  40ms:  1m 9s (comfortable starts here)
  90ms:  1m 19s
  160ms: 1m 33s (still fast compared to v2.0rc8)
  
*** (all times measured for a complete sync with 1 ROM (linux+xmidi2x2))


v2.0rc8

* make sure value numbers in envelope editor play nicely with background color
* fixed menu not behaving (since rc7)
* focus channel selection on startup (no point to focus the name)
* removed global "ESC to quit" shortcut so ESC can be used to close
  subwindows again. Oops
* pressing B will play an A now
* changed channel and preset selection callbacks from "when released" to
  "when changed"
* all widgets now believe in Drag'n'Drop. Basically the whole
  main window is now Drag'n'Drop area.

* drag.n.drop could crash prodatum. fixed.

* slightly changed default color palette
* enabled closed loop downloads by default
* scopes don't resize, hide 'em when window != max
