v2.0rc11

* autofocus knobs when hovered.
* minipianos: mousewheel can shift keyrange (octave)
* when saving a preset, update the internal clone too


v2.0rc10

* channel selection doesn't work properly (rc9 regression). fixed.
* mixer flickers when changing preset/channel/edit all. fixed.
* master volume saved with config (default lvl: 80).
  will be applied on startup.

v2.0rc9

* program arp "COPY FROM": ROM selector would not update preset brwosa. fixed.
* slightly compressed preferences dialog
* synchronization got a turbo (***):
  v2.0rc8: 2m 09s
  v1.0.0:  1m 13s
  v2.0rc9: 1m 1s
* "Delay" effect on synchronizing (***):
  0ms:   1m 1s (check your browsers, may result in missing names)
  10ms:  1m 3s (safe option for me)
  40ms:  1m 9s (comfortable starts here)
  90ms:  1m 19s
  160ms: 1m 33s (still fast compared to v2.0rc8)
  
*** (all times measured for a complete sync with 1 ROM (linux+xmidi2x2))


v2.0rc8

* make sure value numbers in envelope editor play nicely with background color
* fixed menu not behaving (since rc7)
* focus channel selection on startup (no point to focus the name)

  subwindows again. Oops
* pressing B will play an A now

  "when changed"

  main window is now Drag'n'Drop area.
