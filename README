 Building
 ########

Get FLTK 1.1.10 and patch it with the fltk_gleam-1.1.10.patch from prodatum's
Git repository. Copy fl_gleam.cxx (also from prodatum's Git repo) to
path/to/fltk-1.1.10/src/ and compile FLTK.

Alternatively you can use your system's FLTK (most likely v1.3.x). I don't
recommend doing so as prodatum's gleam theme is highly modified and linking
against an unpatched FLTK will make prodatum look 'not as nice'.*

Get and compile portmidi (I recommend the SVN version).

Alternatively you can use your system's portmidi installation.*

Use CMake to create prodatum's Makefiles. The Makefiles will look in
path/to/prodatum-source/lib/ and path/to/prodatum-source/include/ for custom
libraries and header files (put SVN/patched versions of portmidi/FLTK here).

Use FLTK's fluid to create the GUI code from prodatum.fl.

Compile prodatum using make.


* NOTE: If you want to use your system's libraries of FLTK and portmidi,
change the last line in CMakeLists.txt as follows
- target_link_libraries (prodatum fltk.a portmidi_s.a ${ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES} )
+ target_link_libraries (prodatum ${ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES} )

and add "fltk portmidi" to the ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES variable for your system.
Eg, for linux:
- set(ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES X11 Xinerama Xft fontconfig asound pthread)
+ set(ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES fltk portmidi X11 Xinerama Xft fontconfig asound pthread)
