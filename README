Building

Get FLTK 1.1.10 and patch it with the fltk_gleam-1.1.10.patch from prodatum's
Git repository. Copy fl_gleam.cxx (also from prodatum's Git repo) to
path/to/fltk-1.1.10/src/ and compile FLTK.

Alternatively you can try to link prodatum against your installed version
of FLTK (most likely version 1.3.x). I don't recommend doing so as prodatum's
gleam theme is highly modified and linking against FLTK 1.3 will make prodatum
look (and possibly behave) differently (I have test-compiled the source code
against FLTK 1.3.2 (static linking) and prodatum worked just fine).

Get and compile portmidi (I recommend the SVN version).

Alternatively you can try to use an shared library (has not been tested but
should work fine).

Use CMake to create prodatum's Makefiles. The Makefiles will look in
path/to/prodatum-source/lib/ and path/to/prodatum-source/include/ for custom
libraries and header files (I only put portmidi/FLTK here).

Use FLTK's fluid to create the GUI code from prodatum.fl.

Compile prodatum.
